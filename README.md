## üìö Description of Classes

### 1. **Asset Class**
- Represents the underlying asset for options.
- Enables simulations and position management for hedging strategies.

### 2. **Option Class**
- Built on the Asset class to represent financial derivatives.
- **Key methods**:
  - Risk Metrics: `DeltaRisk`, `GammaRisk`, `VegaRisk`, `ThetaRisk`, `VannaRisk`, `VolgaRisk`
  - Pricing: `option_price_mc`, `option_price_close_formulae`
  - Visualization: `display_payoff_option`, `RiskAnalysis`, `PnlRisk`
### 3. **Option 1st Generation**
- Comprises European vanilla options (e.g., spreads, straddles, strangles).
- Inherits features from the `Option` class for advanced analysis.

### 4. **Book Class**
- Combines multiple options (European or 1st Generation) into a portfolio.
- Focused on a single underlying asset for simplicity.

### 5. **Booking Request**
- Updates a booking Excel file to manage option book positions.
- Computes Mark-to-Market (MtM) values and assesses risk exposure.

## :zap: Subprojects

I have also led parallel studies on:
- **Optimizations**.
- **DA Power Correlations** between countries.
- **Cross-Border Optimizations** in power markets.
- **Swing Options** for energy markets.
- **Pricing CSSOs**.

This library integrates these research insights into actionable tools for advanced financial and energy market analysis.

## üéØ Motivations

This project began in **Fall 2023** and has evolved with three main goals:
1. **Academic Exploration**: Integrate advanced quantitative finance approaches.
2. **Personal Library**: Develop a Python toolkit for advanced option strategies.
3. **Portfolio Management**: Study and manage the evolution of option books over time.

The **Quantitative Finance Library** is now a robust tool for risk analysis and option portfolio management, leveraging simulations and dynamic risk profiling.
